## FinTrack

**FinTrack** is a personal finance web dashboard designed to help users organize, visualize, and optimize their financial management. The platform allows users to record, classify, and manage income and expenses in a structured way, making it easier to analyze financial behavior through tables, key performance indicators (KPIs), and interactive graphical visualizations.

The system provides features for managing custom categories, tracking savings goals, and visualizing monthly financial trends, enabling users to make informed decisions about their personal finances. Additionally, FinTrack includes an administrative panel that offers a global view of the system, from which administrators can manage users, monitor overall statistics, and generate consolidated financial reports.
